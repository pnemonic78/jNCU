	Session and application commands.
 
	<h2>Session commands</h2>
	<h3>Starting a session</h3>
	<br />2.0 Newton supports a new set of protocols to enhance the
	connection capabilities. However, since it's desirable to also support
	package downloading from NPI, NTK 1.0 and Connection 2.0 the ROMs will
	also support the old protocol for downloading packages. To make this
	work the 2.0 ROMs will pretend that they are talking the old protocol
	when they send the
	<tt>kDRequestToDock</tt>
	message. If a new connection (or other application) is on the other end
	the protocol will be negotiated up to the current version. Only package
	loading is supported with the old protocol.
	<p />
	No matter what the intent of the desktop or the Newton, these commands
	must always start a session (the desktop can substitute a
	<tt>kDResult</tt>
	for the
	<tt>kDSetTimeout</tt>
	if it doesn't want to set the timeout).
	<p />
	<h4>Examples</h4>
	<br />When a 2.0 ROM Newton is communicating with a 3.0 Connection
	the session would start like this:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Desktop</th>
			<th>&#x2194;</th>
			<th>Newton</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDRequestToDock</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDInitiateDocking</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDNewtonName</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDDesktopInfo</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDNewtonInfo</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDWhichIcons</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
			<td>// optional</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDResult</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDSetTimeout</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDPassword</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDPassword</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br />If the password sent from the Newton is wrong it would look
	like this instead. The password exchange can occur up to 3 times before
	the desktop gives up.
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDPassword</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDPWWrong</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDPassword</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDPWWrong</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDPassword</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDPassword</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br />If the password sent from the Desktop is wrong the Newton
	signals an error immediately.
	<table>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDPassword</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDPassword</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDResult</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
	<br />If the desktop decides that the Newton has had enough guesses a
	<tt>kDResult</tt>
	can be sent instead of a
	<tt>kDPWWrong</tt>
	. A
	<tt>kDBadPassword</tt>
	error should be specified. No matter what the intent of the desktop or
	the Newton, these commands must always start a session (the desktop can
	substitute a
	<tt>kDResult</tt>
	for the
	<tt>kDSetTimeout</tt>
	if it doesn't want to set the timeout).
	<p />
	If no password has been specified, the key is returned unencrypted.
	<p />
	When a 2.0 ROM Newton is communicating with NPI 1.0, NTK 1.0 or 2.0
	Connection the session would look like this:
	<table>
		<tr>
			<th>Desktop</th>
			<th>&#x2194;</th>
			<th>Newton</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDRequestToDock</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDInitiateDocking</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
			<td>// session type must be loadpackage</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDNewtonName</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDSetTimeout</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDResult</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDLoadPackage</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td></td>
			<td>&#x2190;</td>
			<td>kDResult</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>kDDisconnect</td>
			<td>&#x2192;</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
