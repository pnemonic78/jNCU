	Newton Docking Protocol.

	<h2>Newton Docking Protocol</h2>
	<br />Newton Docking Protocol event commands for 2.0 Newton ROM
	Extensions.
	<br />Newton communicates with the desktop by exchanging Newton event
	commands.
	<p />
	In the commands below, all data is padded with nulls to 4 byte
	boundaries. The length associated with each command is the length (in
	bytes) of the data following the length field. All strings are C
	strings unless otherwise specified.
	<p />
	All commands begin with the sequence -- '
	<tt>newt</tt>
	', '
	<tt>dock</tt>
	'.
	<br />Newton communicates with the desktop by exchanging Newton event
	commands. The general command structure looks like this:
	<pre>
'newt'
'dock'
'aaaa'   // the specific command
length   // the length of the following command
data     // data, if any
</pre>

	<h3>Compatibility</h3>
	<br />The protocol described above for 2.0 is a superset of the 1.0
	protocol. However, the protocol version has been incremented so old
	versions of Newton Connection will no longer work with this version.
	The reason for this is that, although the protocol itself is upwardly
	compatible, the data structures in other parts of the 2.0 Newton have
	changed to such a degree that old versions of Newton Connection will no
	longer work.
	<h3>Desktop Initiated Functions while connected</h3>
	<br />With the advent of the new protocol, the Newton and the desktop
	can be connected, but with no command specified. A command can be
	requested by the user on either the Newton or the Desktop.
