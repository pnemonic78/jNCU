	Remote query commands.

	<h2>Remote query commands</h2>
	<br />All of the commands in this section are based on the
	NewtonScript query functions. Please see the Newton Programmer's Guide
	(NPG) for details about the functions performed by the commands. The
	query command returns a long representing the queries' cursor. Each of
	the other commands take this cursor as a parameter. Entries are
	returned with the
	<tt>kDEntry</tt>
	command.
