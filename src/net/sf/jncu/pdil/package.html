	<h2>PDIL Interface</h2>
	<br />The Protocol Desktop Integration Library (PDIL) is a library
	designed to make it easy (and possible) for desktop developers to write
	applications to exchange data with Newton devices by communicating with
	the built-in Dock (Connection) application.
	<p>
	<h2>About the PDIL</h2>
	<br>The PDIL allows a desktop application to communicate with the
	Dock application on a Newton 2.x device. The PDIL supports multiple
	sessions to different Newton devices. The PDIL also supports password
	protection to your application, where a password needs to be entered on
	the Newton device before a PDIL session is created.
	<br>The PDIL requires the use of the FDIL. The PDIL and the Dock
	application trade NewtonScript objects, which are FDIL objects on the
	desktop. The PDIL also requires the use of some communication scheme.
	You can use the CDIL, but this is not required. You may implement this
	link in some other manner.
	<br>The PDIL provides functions to:
	<ul>
		<li>get a list of stores and soups
		<li>add, empty, and delete soups
		<li>read, edit, and create new entries in a soup
		<li>perform soup queries and navigate soup with cursors
		<li>call global functions and root view methods
		<li>download packages
		<li>extend the protocol to execute an arbitrary NewtonScript
			function object
	</ul>
