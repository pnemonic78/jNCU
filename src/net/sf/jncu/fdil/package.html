	<h2>FDIL Interface</h2>
	<br />The Frames Desktop Integration Library (FDIL) is a small library
	allowing the creation and manipulation of NewtonScript objects. Because
	the objects the FDIL manipulates on are NewtonScript-compatible, they
	can be exchanged with Newton devices using communications libraries
	such as the CDIL.
	<br>The FDIL can create any type of NewtonScript object, including
	virtual binary objects, and frames and arrays with circular references.
	The FDIL, unlike NewtonScript, does not provide automatic garbage
	collection.
	<p>
	<h2>About the FDIL Objects</h2>
	<br>The objects the FDIL manipulate mimic the NewtonScript
	objects. There is a one-to-one correspondence between NewtonScript and
	FDIL objects. There are a number of minor implementation details that
	differ, however.
